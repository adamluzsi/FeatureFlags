# [toggler.io](https://toggler.io)

`toggler.io` is a SaaS solution for those who like the project,
but don't want to keep, manage, optimize and scale the service on-premise.

The managed version focuses on:
 
* response time SLA
  * close to only network latency
    * so page load times with toggler.io kept minimum for the end-users
* Third party integrations
* cost efficiency
* geo location based distribution
  * regardless of your infrastructure location
    the service must be not a bottleneck in your end-user experience stories.
* support at gaining insights about experiments
* SaaS without vendor-lock
  * all data you have in the service will be transparently exportable to your on-prem solution,
    so you don't have to worry about vendor locks,
    and your data team can work more easily on the data. 

It is also the plan to make the service cost efficient to the level,
where the service can be used for free.

The site is currently under construction.
