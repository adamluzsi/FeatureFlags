# Why toggler, why not ${PRODUCT_NAME} ?

`toggler` primary goal is to provide a vendor-lock free solution to a wide range of audience.
The API's follow simple conventions, making transition easy to almost any other service
in case the service is not enough for the company/team needs.

The secondary goal is derived from the primary, which is to own the data.
Regardless how and where you use, the ownership of the data belongs to you.
There is no `free` plan that aims you to lock in by data, or by other means.

If you are satisfied with the service,
then the `toggler` project did well.
